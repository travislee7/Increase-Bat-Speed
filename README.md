# Increase Bat Speed
Conducted data analysis on hitting metadata csv provided from the Driveline Open Biomechanics GitHub

This program reads data from metadata.csv located in the github directory drivelineresearch/openbiomechanics/baseball_hitting/data. It filters the data by the heights, weights, and highest playing levels of the hitters and records their bat speeds. It then arranges the data by these categories and calculates the average bat speed for each group. 

The results are displayed in sentences and bar graphs using the matplotlib library. The average bat speeds for each category are calculated in separate classes, such as heightcalculate.py, which determines the average bat speed of hitters based on their height. 

I have created a report in Google Docs that summarizes the findings of my program's calculations. Link is below.
