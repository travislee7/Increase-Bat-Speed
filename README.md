# Hitting Metadata Analysis with Matplotlib
This Python program conducts data analysis on hitting metadata provided from the Driveline Open Biomechanics GitHub repository.

# Overview
The program reads data from metadata.csv located in the GitHub directory drivelineresearch/openbiomechanics/baseball_hitting/data. It filters the data based on the heights, weights, and highest playing levels of the hitters and records their bat speeds. The program then organizes the data into categories according to these attributes and calculates the average bat speed for each group.

# Features
- Reads hitting metadata from metadata.csv.
- Filters and categorizes data by heights, weights, and playing levels.
- Calculates average bat speed for each category.
- Displays results in sentences and bar graphs using the Matplotlib library.
- Utilizes separate classes for calculating average bat speed for different categories.

# Report
